> How could you use `arrange()` to sort all missing values to the start? (Hint: use `is.na())`.
## 1
```{r}
flights %>% arrange(desc(is.na(dep_time)))
```

## 2

> Sort flights to find the most delayed flights. Find the flights that left earliest.
```{r}
flights %>% arrange(dep_delay)
```

## 3

> Sort flights to find the fastest flights.

```{r}
flights %>% arrange(air_time)
```

## 4
> Which flights traveled the longest? Which traveled the shortest? 

```{r}
flights %>% arrange(desc(distance))
```
